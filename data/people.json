      "description":"Ph.D. Computational Neuroscience, Vision Institute and Paris VI University, France. Even in small animals such as flies, there is an important diversity in brain activation patterns across individuals. My goal is to reveal the set of rules underlying this diversity, and to understand how these rules generate functional biological neural networks. For this I develop methods of analysis using linear algebra, machine learning and physics and apply them to recordings of whole brain activity from many flies.",

      "description":"Ph.D Physics, The Hebrew University.<br>Many problems in neuroscience and in machine learning involve many variables that interact in ways that we can’t observe or understand. However, as we have learned from other physical systems, some collective behaviors do not depend on the microscopic details.  I employ various mean-filed theories, and models of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to describe  emergent phenomena using a handful of order-parameters. Often times, studying the interactions and dynamics of the order-parameter yield new understandings and guide the design of experiments and new algorithms. Problems I study include recurrent and deep neural networks and high dimensional inference.",
